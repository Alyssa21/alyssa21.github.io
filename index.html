	       <h1> What are dogs?
The domestic dog is a member of genus Canis that forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant carnivore.
Its Scientific name is Canis lupus familiaris.
		      Todays many different breeds, all sizes, shapes, colours, and temprments, of dogs share a common ancestor in an extinct wolf lineage that lived thousands of years ago.
Dogs were just a loose category of wolves until around 15,000 years ago, when our ancestors tamed and began to manage them. We fed            them, bred them, and spread them from continent to continent. While other wolf descendants died out, dogs grew into a new species. Thus dogs came into existance.
